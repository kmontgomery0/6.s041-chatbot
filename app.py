        TODO:Generate a response for the current message in a Gradio chat interface.
        
        This function is called by Gradio's ChatInterface every time a user sends a message.
        You only need to generate and return the assistant's response - Gradio handles the
        chat display and history management automatically.

        Args:
            message (str): The current message from the user
            history (list): List of previous message pairs, where each pair is
                           [user_message, assistant_message]
                           Example:
                           [
                               ["What schools offer Spanish?", "The Hernandez School..."],
                               ["Where is it located?", "The Hernandez School is in Roxbury..."]
                           ]

        Returns:
            str: The assistant's response to the current message.


        Note:
            - Gradio automatically:
                - Displays the user's message
                - Displays your returned response
                - Updates the chat history
                - Maintains the chat interface
            - You only need to:
                - Generate an appropriate response to the current message
                - Return that response as a string
